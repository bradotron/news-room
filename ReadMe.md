# The News Room

This is the new-room app, created as a team project for the GW University Full-Stack Developer boot camp.

* The app is deployed to [Heroku](https://ancient-river-63990.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started
Open you command line interface and execute the following commands:
1. ```git clone git@github.com:bradotron/news-room.git```
2. ```cd news-room```
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm start```
5. The React development server will automatically open a browser window, but if it does not, go to [The Home Page](https://localhost:3000)
